[OWASP Coraza](https://github.com/corazawaf/coraza) Caddy Module provides Web Application Firewall capabilities for Caddy.

OWASP Coraza WAF is 100% compatible with OWASP Coreruleset and Modsecurity syntax.

## Plugin syntax

```caddy
coraza_waf {
 directives `
  Include /path/to/config.conf
  SecAction "id:1,pass,log"
 `
}
```

Sample usage:  

**Important:** `order coraza_waf first` must be always included in your Caddyfile for Coraza module to work

```caddy
{
    order coraza_waf first
}

http://127.0.0.1:8080 {
 coraza_waf {
  directives `
   SecAction "id:1,pass,log"
   SecRule REQUEST_URI "/test5" "id:2, deny, log, phase:1"
   SecRule REQUEST_URI "/test6" "id:4, deny, log, phase:3"
   Include file1.conf 
   Include file2.conf
   Include /some/path/*.conf
  `
 }
 reverse_proxy http://192.168.1.15:8080
}
```

## Build Caddy with Coraza WAF

Run:

```shell
xcaddy build --with github.com/corazawaf/coraza-caddy
```

## Testing

You may run the test suite by executing:

```shell
go run mage.go test
```

## Using OWASP Core Ruleset

You can load OWASP CRS by passing the field `load_owasp_crs` and then load the CRS files in the directives as described in the [coraza-coreruleset](https://github.com/corazawaf/coraza-coreruleset) documentation.

```caddy
:8080 {
 coraza_waf {
  load_owasp_crs
  directives `
   Include @coraza.conf-recommended
   Include @crs-setup.conf.example
   Include @owasp_crs/*.conf
   SecRuleEngine On
  `
 }

 reverse_proxy httpbin:8081
}
```
